    The Fields extension adds functionality to the `/search` endpoint which allows the caller to include or exclude
    specific from the API response.  Registering this extension with the application has the added effect of removing
    the `ItemCollection` response model from the `/search` endpoint, as the Fields extension allows the API to return
    potentially invalid responses by excluding fields which are required by the STAC spec, such as geometry.
